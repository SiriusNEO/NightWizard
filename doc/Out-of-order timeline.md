Out-of-order timeline: *reference only*

- Before Week 7: 1. Read CAAQA and make sure you **understand** how Tomasulo works 2. configure your Vivado environment and prepare for your editor ( VSCode or plugined Idea)
- Week 7: Build a skeleton (create files and modules, finish ALU and decode (recognizing what the instruction is is enough) )
- Week 8: Design your Register files,  skeleton of RS and ROB and how your instruction flowed from decode into RS/ROB/other necessery modules
- Week 9: Complete your design of RS&ROB
- Week 10: Add IF, finish the rest with basic design, debug and try to pass simulation
- Week 11: Add I-cache, deal with ROB flush when misbranch and debug
- Week 12: handle problems about memory, design structures and debug
- Week 13: Debug until you pass simulation
- Week 14: Run on FPGA, debug
- Week 15: Debug
- Week 16: Debug
